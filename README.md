# Multi-Source-Azure-Data-Migration
This project involves migrating data from multiple sources, including flat files and SQL databases, into Azure. The workflow is designed to first land the data in the Azure Data Lake, which subsequently triggers an Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipeline to load the data into an Azure database.
